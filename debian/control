Description:  Microsoft Kinect sensor modules for the OpenNI framework
 OpenNI is a framework for getting data to support 'Natural Interaction',
 i.e. skeleton tracking, gesture tracking, and similar ways of getting data
 from humans. This package provides modules for OpenNI that get the data from
 the Kinect camera for processing with the OpenNI Middleware, like PrimeSense
 NITE.
 .
 This module is an unofficial 'avin2' branch of PrimeSense Sensors patched for
 Kinect support.
